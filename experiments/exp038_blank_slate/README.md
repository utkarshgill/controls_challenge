# Experiment 038: Blank Slate

## Objective

**Stop and think.** Before jumping into more training runs, network architectures, or hyperparameter tuning, we need to deeply understand the **physics** of what we're trying to learn and control.

## Hypothesis

The best solutions come from **understanding the problem deeply**, not from trying random architectures and hoping they work.

## Approach

Pure physics analysis. No code. Just:
1. Understanding the physical system
2. Understanding the dynamics we're learning
3. Understanding what makes this problem hard
4. Understanding what good control means

## Key Document

See `PHYSICS_ANALYSIS.md` for the complete physics analysis of the TinyPhysics challenge.

## What We Learned

*(To be filled in after reflection)*

## Next Steps

After deeply understanding the physics:
1. Design state representations that match physical intuition
2. Choose architectures that respect system structure
3. Design loss functions that capture physical objectives
4. Validate that learned models behave physically

## Philosophy

**"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."**

This experiment is about achieving that simple, deep understanding before building anything.
